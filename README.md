# POKEMON BUT TEXT BASED

I took on the challenge of making a text-based version of pokemon which is mostly fully featured.
It inculdes movement, storyline, most importantly battle mechanics and dialogue is displayed with slow writing text to really sell the old school pokemon vibe.

# Installation 
Download the files and run the game.py file in your terminal


Any feedback and or critisim 100% appreciated. 
Thanks, zac
